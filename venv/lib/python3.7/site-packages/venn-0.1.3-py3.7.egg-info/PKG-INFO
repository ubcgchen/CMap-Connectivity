Description: # pyvenn: Venn diagrams for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sets
        
        Please refer to the Jupyter notebook for demos and a brief explanation of the
        interface; a more complete documentation is in the works as the project keeps
        evolving:  
        https://github.com/LankyCyril/pyvenn/blob/master/pyvenn-demo.ipynb
        
        This library is an evolution of tctianchi's pyvenn package (see fork URL).  
        Their liberal license (Unlicense) allowed me to fork the repository,
        change the license to GPLv3, modify the package's interface and, hopefully,
        significantly contribute to and improve the library, and make it installable
        from PyPI.
        
        The main methods in this version are different from the ones in tctianchi's
        implementation, but the original methods are still provided for backwards
        compatibility, and I would like to emphasize the importance of tctianchi's work
        that allowed for this library to exist (among other things, figuring out the
        coordinates best fit for plotting the diagrams' shapes and petals' labels).
        
        This iteration of the library implements two main functions:
        * `venn(dataset_dict, **kwargs)` which plots true Venn diagrams for any number
        of sets between 2 and 5 using ellipses, and for 6 sets using triangles
        * `pseudovenn(dataset_dict, **kwargs)` which plots a Venn-like intersection of
        six circles (not all intersections are present in such a plot, but many are).
